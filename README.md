## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet library

I made this app in order to alleviate a common obstacle within the Zelda TotK game where we are provided coordinates, but no way to visualize those coordinates. It took me a while to integrate the leaflet libary properly with different layers, but it was worth it. I even shared this on Reddit where it got a bit of attention!

## Optimizations

Upon request by reddit, I did add in grid lines.
I could definitely add in things like item locations, or a z-index coordinate. The ability to have local storage and save the user's last few markers with custom marker names is something I definitely want to incorporate as well.

## Lessons Learned:

It was very interesting to have to deal with the leaflet library. The more technology I get introduced to, the more ismilar it becomes. One thing that became evident was having to see other people's use of the leaflet technology in order to get a better idea of how to actually use it. Sometimes the docs aren't so clear, so it makes it necessary to reach out to other projects.
